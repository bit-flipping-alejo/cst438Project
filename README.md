# cst438Project

***IMPORTANT PLEASE FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS***
ToDo before running the first time:
	> In MYSQL create "cst438project" schema
	> Port settings and address location are already defaulted to 
	'localhost:3306/cst438project'
		> change this if needed in order to point to your local MySQL setup
	> Update the application.propetries in the resources folder
		> confirm database location is correct.
		> update spring.datasource.username
		> update spring.datasource.password
		
No other scripts are required to run. Server initialization will take care of all data population
Please ensure the localhost MySQL server is running with the proper credentials and the required
schema is present.
